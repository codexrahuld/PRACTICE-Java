Q2/-  How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
	Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to
	establish these relationships among tables with Example.
	
Ans:-

	There are 3 Different types of relationship exit among tables in the database.
	1) One to One
	2) One to Many
	3) Many to Many
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	One to one relationships:-
	One to one relationship is very rarely used relationship. 
	
	Example:- 
	In the database we want to store employee but also their valid identity card we are 
	not interested to storing any other types of documents or identity cards that we 
	previously valid so we need exactly one identity card.
	
	One employee can have only one one identity card.
	One Identity card can belong to only one employee.
	This is the One To One Relationship
	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	one to Many Relationship
	
	In one to many relationship we simply add table1 primary key to table2 as foreign key,
	Imagine that we want to store employee in database for each employee also store department but in 
	separate table that time we use one to many relationship.
	
	Example:-  Department Table did is primary key we store this in employee table as foreign key
	
	+-------+------------+------------+
	|did | dname | location | 
	+-------+------------+------------+
	| 1|Account  |nashik |
	| 2|Sales    pune |
	| 3|HR |   Mumbai |
	| 4|Marketing | Thane |
	+-------+------------+------------+
	
	employee table we store deptid of department table as foreign key in employee table
		+-------+------------+------------+-------+-----------+---------+
		|empid | ename | address | mobile | salary | deptid |
		+-------+------------+------------+-------+-----------+---------+
		| 1| rahul | nashik | 9877886675 | 11000 | 1 |

		Many to Many Relationship
		
		In Many to Many relationship both tables could have multiple rows on the other side.
		
		Example:
		One employee during the time can call many customer also one customer during the time 
		could recived call from many employees.
		
		We need to create 3 table here
		1. employee
		2. customer
		3.call table(for maintaining the relationships).
