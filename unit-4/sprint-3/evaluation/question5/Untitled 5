 What is object downcasting?
b. Explain with a code example.

Ans:- A.

		Downcasting in java means the typecasting of a parent object to a child object. It cannot be implicit.
		The referrence of the parent class object is passd to the child class. The methods and variables of both the 
		classes can be accessed.
		
	B.
	Example:-
	Let there be a parent  class. There can be many children of a parent, A parent may or may not inherits the child's properties. 
	However, we can forcefully cast a parent to a child which is known as downcasting. 
	
	class Parent {
	
	String name;
	
	void method()
	{
		System.out.println("Method From Parent");
		}
	}
	
	class child extends Parent {
	int id;
	
	@Override  void method()
	{
		System.out.println("zMethod From Child");
		}
		
		}
		
	public class ABC {
	
	public static vaoid main(String[] args)
	
	{
	
	Parent P = new Child();
	p.name = "Deshmane";
	
	System.out.println(p.name);
	
	p.method();
	
	Child c = (Child)p;
	
	c.id = 1;
	
	System.out.println(c.name);
	System.out.println(c. id);
	c.method();
	}
	}
