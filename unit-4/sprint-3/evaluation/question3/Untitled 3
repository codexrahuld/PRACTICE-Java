Final Keyword In Java.
	
	In the Java programming language Final keyword plays the important role.
	The Final keyword in java is used to restrict the user, means to stop the execution at certain time, It can be used in
	many context, Like in variable method or class.
	
	1) Final with variable
		The final keyword can be applied with the variables, a final variable that have no value it is called blank final variable, 
		It can be initialized in the constructor only. The blank final variable can be static also which will be initialized in the 
		static block only. If we can make any variable as final, then we cannot change the value of final variable(It will constant).
		
	2) Final with method.
		If we can make any method as final, then we cannot override it. The final method cannot be override by any chance, 
		It will stay constant as whatever it is previously. we can be able to inherit the final method but cannot override.
		
	3) We can declare, a class with a final keyword in java. When we declare a class as final, then we restrict other classes to 
		inherit or extend it. In short java final class can't be extended by other classes in the inheritance.
