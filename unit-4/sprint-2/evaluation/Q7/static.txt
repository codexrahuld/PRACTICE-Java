Ans:- In the java programming language, or in object oriented programming language Static means that the 
		particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type,  It means we will create 
		only one instance of that static member that is shared across all instances of the class.
		The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly.
