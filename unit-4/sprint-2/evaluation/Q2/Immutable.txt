What do you understand by “Java Strings are immutable”.
Explain the advantages and disadvantages of immutability of
Strings.


Ans:- In Object oriented programming or in java Immutable strings means that cannot be modified once it is created. 
		But we can only change the reference to the object.
		The string is Immutable in java because of the security, caching, and class loading.  The reason of making string 
		final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it.
		
		
		*Advantages:- 1) Improve Performance.
						2) Easy to copy.
						3) Being Immutable makes the string theread safe.
						
		* Disadvantages:- We can not concatinate.
