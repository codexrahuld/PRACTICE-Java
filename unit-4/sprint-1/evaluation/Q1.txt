package Q1: Explain the four pillars of object-oriented programming.

Ans:-> The four Pillars of object oriented Programming Are as follows.
    1) Abstraction: Abstraction is the method in which the concept include is it can wrapping up complex actions
                    in simple verbs. It means wrapping the same kind of data into one bundle. It can hide the
                    complexity.
    2) Encapsulation: Encapsulation means the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule. Removing
                       access to parts of your code and making things private. it also means Each object in your
                       code should control its own state.
    3) Inheritance: Inheritance is the concept which says that the child has all the properties of his parent.
                       Reusability is the main method used in the Inheritance, It lets one object acquire the
                       properties and methods of another object.
    4) Polymorphism: The term mean as Poly means Many And morphs means types.  It says that The Condition of
                        occuring in several different forms. It occurs when we ahve many classes that are
                        related to each other.
