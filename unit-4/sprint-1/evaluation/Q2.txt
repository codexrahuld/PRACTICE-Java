Q2: Differentiate between JRE, JVM and JDK.


Ans:-  JDK :- Java Development Kit (JDk) is a software development environment used for developing java
                applications and applets. it includes the java Runtime Environment(JRE) an interpreter/loader
                a compiler or a documentation generator and some other tools also.

       JRE :- It is stands for Java Runtime Environment, The java Runtime Environment provides the minimum
                requirements for execution a java application, It is an istallation package that provides an
                environment to only run the java program.

       JVM :- JVM Stands for Java Virtual Machine: It is the part of both JDK and JRE because it is ontained in both.
                It includes a Specification where the working of java virtul machine is specified,
                but implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm.
                An implementation is the a computer program that meets the requirements of the JVM
                specification.
