Ans:- Java is easy to learn, general purpose, robust, secure, and object-oriented programming language. 
	It is a high-level language, java syntax uses English language. 
	Java uses automatic garbage collection, therefore we don't need to remove the unreferenced objects from memory.
	Java uses object-oriented paradigm, which makes it more practical. Everything in java is an object which takes
	care of both data and behaviour.
	Java is secure programming lanuage because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Also, java programs run inside the 
	Virtual machine sandbox.
