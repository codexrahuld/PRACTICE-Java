Q.3)
 Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.



    ANS:->
     The equals is similar to the == operator, which is to test for object identity 
    rather than object equality. The hashCode is a method by which a class implicitly
    or explicitly break down the data stored in an instance of the class into a single hash value,
    which is a 32 bit signed integer. The key difference between equals and hashCode in Java is that
    the equals is used to compare two objects while the hashCode is used in hashing to decide
    which group an object should be categorized into.
